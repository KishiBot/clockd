# Clockd
This is my silly small cli clock project.<br>
Literally couldn't find cli clock that would let me specify rgb values for color.<br>
So I got angry and written this in like 3 hours.<br>
<br>
Works only on linux (uses unistd for usleep.. I don't think anyone will use this and I totally don't think anyone on windows or mac would want to use this so it probably doesn't matter)<br>

You can specify color using -c flag like this: `-c #rrggbb`.
